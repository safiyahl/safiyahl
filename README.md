# Hi! My name is Safiyah! 

Welcome to my github !

I am a French and Arabic graduate and as part of my degree,  I studied abroad at the University of Damascus in Syria. This was an enlightening experience where I learnt so much about myself, the arabic language and vibrant syrian culture.

I have been a full-time carer/stay at home mother for the last nine years. During this time I worked in retail as a sales assistant, then I moved on as a freelance interpreter and I also set up several businesses. I love to challenge myself and pursue my interests. I am a keen and avid learner and I am looking for a career that I feel really passionate about.

Recently I have been learning how to code in an endeavour to find out whether that it could be a career path for me and I LOVE it. I love problem-solving and the vastness of the tech industry!  

I am excited about starting my web developmentjourney with the school of code and I am so looking forward to the future and all that it has to offer!
