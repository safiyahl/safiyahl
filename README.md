# Hi! My name is Safiyah! Welcome to my github !

I am a French and Arabic graduate and I studied abroad in Syria as part of my university degree. This was an amazing experience where I learnt so much about myself and the Arabic language.

I have been a full-time carer/stay at home mother for the last nine years. During this time I worked part time in retail, then I worked as a freelance interpreter and I also set up several businesses. Needless to say, when I get an idea into my head I run with it and really give it a go. I like to pursue different things in order to find out more about myself and my interests. 
I love being a mum but I also feel like something is missing; financial independance and job stability.

Recently I have been learning how to code in an endeavour to find out whether that could be the career for me and I LOVE it. I love problem-solving and the vastness of the tech industry! I'm starting to think this is the missing piece to my puzzle after all! 

I am excited about starting my web developmentjourney with the school of code and I am so looking forward to the future and all that it has to offer!
